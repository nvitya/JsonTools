# JsonTools (nvitya fork)
A small pascal based json parser in one unit with no dependencies.
Its interface is much simpler, better designed, than the official Delphi JSON.

Please visit this [page](https://www.getlazarus.org/json/) for a complete guide on how to use this parser.

# nvitya Fork Notes
The jsontool.pas was originally published here: https://github.com/sysrpl/JsonTools
Due the Delphi incompatiblity and some other problems I forked and changed it.
